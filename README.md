## Abstract

Inspired by the [AspectJ](https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/) java framework,
AspectJS Leverages [ES Decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) to bring
aspect-oriented programming to Javascript and Typescript.

This is repository is a pending rewrite of my [first attempt](https://github.com/NicolasThierion/aspectjs), which became hard to maintain.
