## <i class="fab fa-java"></i> A lesson learned from Java

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programmation paradigm that introduced a clean way of handling cross-cutting concerns.
It has become very popular in _Java_ with frameworks [AspectJ](https://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/), and it changed the way we develop applications with _Java_.

AOP made it possible to design among the most popular java frameworks like Spring or Hibernate.
Moreover, by providing a consistent syntax and an independent tooling, it made it possible to create behaviors that work across different frameworks.

I truly thing javascript lacks this kind of interoperability today, and we often have a hard time to write code that is portable between react, angular, node and browser.

## <i class="fa fa-gift"></i> ES decorators

> What about ES decorators ?

Some javascript frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) or [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) already use ES/TS Decorators to kind of achieve AOP, but with 2 major drawbacks:

- ES decorators are hard to design
- Unlike _Java annotations_, ES decorators encapsulate the behaviour themself, so they offer poor extensibility and are not portable useable among different frameworks.

This library is a proof of concept to show true AOP is possible with JavaScript, even without the flexibility of the _Java Reflection API_, and I want to see if this idea can gain popularity and maybe get adopted by other javascript developers.
