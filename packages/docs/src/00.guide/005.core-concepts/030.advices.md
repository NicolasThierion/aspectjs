# <i class="fa fa-cube"></i> Advice

_Advices_ are the methods of an _Aspect_ that are configured to stop at specific points in the program, identified by an **advice type** - a moment in the execution flow of the program, and a location in the code - known as ["**pointcuts**"](#pointcuts).

## <i class="fa-solid fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> Advice type

The advice type tells when the behavior of an aspect should be integrated.
AspectJS supports the following [Advice Types](../../api/enums/core.AdviceType.md):

- [`@Before`](../../api/modules/core.md#before): runs the advice before the execution of the _joinpoint_.
- [`@Around`](../api/modules/core.html#around): wraps the advice around the execution of the _joinpoint_, allowing you to execute custom code before and after the join point, intercept arguments, or even skip the execution of the original joinpoint;
- [`@AfterReturn`](../api/modules/core.html#afterreturn): runs the advice after _joinpoint_ completes without errors.
- [`@AfterThrow`](../api/modules/core.html#afterthrow): runs the advice after the _joinpoint_ throws an error.
- [`@After`](../api/modules/core.html#after): runs the advice after the _joinpoint_ returns or throws.

An advice is any method in an aspect class annotated with one of the above annotations.

:::code-tabs
@tab example.aspect.ts

```ts
@Aspect()
class ExampleAspect {
  @Before(...)
  exampleAdvice() {}
}
```

## <i class="fa-solid fa-scissors"></i> Pointcut

A pointcut is an expression that specifies the locations in a codebase where the aspect's behavior should be integrated.

:::code-tabs

```ts
import { on } from '@aspectjs/core';

// stops at an annotated class
on.classes.withAnnotations();
// stops at the read of an annotated property
on.properties.withAnnotations();
// stops at the write of an annotated property
on.properties.setter.withAnnotations();
// stops at the call of an annotated method
on.methods.withAnnotations();
// stops at the call of a method with annotated parameters
on.parameters.withAnnotations();
```

:::

> **warn** Unlike _AOP_ in other languages, AspectJS currenlty only supports pointcuts based on annotated elements.

Advices can be configured with several poincut at the same time:

:::code-tabs
@tab log-errors.aspect.ts

```ts
import { AfterThrow, AfterThrowContext, Aspect, on } from '@aspectjs/core';

@Aspect()
export class LogErrorsAspect {
  @AfterThrow(
    on.classes.withAnnotations(LogErrors, Monitored),
    on.methods.withAnnotations(LogErrors, Monitored),
  )
  logAround(context: AfterThrowContext, error: Error) {
    console.error(
      `${context.target}(${context.args.join(',')}) throwed error ${error}`,
    );
    // Propagate the error
    throw error;
  }
}
```

:::

## <i class="fa fa-box"/> Advice context

Each advice is getting called with a `context` passed as 1st argument, which holds the following details about execution context:

:::code-tabs
@tab AdviceContext

```ts
export interface AdviceContext {
  /** The annotations context. Find all annotations on the current target **/
  readonly annotations: BoundAnnotationFilter<ToAnnotationKind<T>>;
  /** The 'this' instance bound to the current execution context **/
  readonly instance: X;
  /** the arguments originally passed to the joinpoint **/
  readonly args: any[];
  /** The location in the code targeted by this advice (class, method, property or parameter **/
  readonly target: AdviceTarget<T, X>;
}
```

:::

> **info** The type of the advice context slightly varies with the type of the advice:
>
> - Before: [BeforeContext](../../api/interfaces/core.BeforeContext.md)
> - Around: [AroundContext](../../api/interfaces/core.AroundContext.md)
> - AfterReturn: [AfterReturnContext](../../api/interfaces/core.AfterReturnContext.md)
> - AfterThrow: [AfterThrowContext](../../api/interfaces/core.AfterThrowContext.md)
> - After: [AfterContext](../../api/interfaces/core.AfterContext.md)
