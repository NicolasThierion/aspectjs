# <i class="fa fa-cube"></i> Aspect

An aspect is a class annotated with the [`@Aspect()` annotation](../../api/modules/core.md#aspect).

The purpose of an aspect is to encapsulate some **cross-cutting concern** in a single place so it can be applied anywhere simply by enabling the aspect.

An aspect is generally composed of one or more methods that is triggered at some places in the code, under some very specific conditions. These methods are called "[**advices**](./030.advices.md)".

:::code-tabs
@tab log-errors.aspect.ts

```ts
import { AfterThrow, on } from '@aspectjs/core';

@Aspect()
export class LogErrorsAspect {
  constructor(protected readonly logMethod = console.error) {}

  // triggered when an error occurs
  @AfterThrow(on.any.withAnnotations(LogErrors))
  logErrorsAdvice(ctxt: AfterThrowContext, error: unknown) {
    // log the error
    this.logMethod(`Error in ${ctxt.target.label}: ${error}`);

    // rethrow the original error
    throw error;
  }
}
```

:::

Like any other class, an aspect can extend another class.
If the parent class is also an aspect, the child aspect will inherit the advices from its parent.

:::code-tabs
@tab log-promise-reject.aspect.ts

```ts
@Aspect()
export class PromiseRejectAspect extends LogErrorsAspect {
  constructor(logMethod = console.error) {
    super(logMethod);
  }

  // inherits @AfterThrow(...) logErrorsAdvice()

  // triggered after a method returns
  @AfterReturn(on.methods.withAnnotations(LogErrors))
  logErrorsAdvice(ctxt: AfterThrowContext, returnValue: unknown) {
    if (returnValue instanceof Promise) {
      // catch rejected promises as well
      return (returnValue as Promise).catch((e) => {
        this.logMethod(`Error in ${ctxt.target.label}: ${e}`);
        return Promise.reject(e);
      });
    }

    return returnValue;
  }
}
```

## <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> Enable the aspect

An aspect has no effect until it has been enabled against the weaver.

The [weaver](../../api/interfaces/core.Weaver.md) is the component in AOP that combines aspects tgether with the codebase by applying the _advices_ at specific points in the program's execution.

:::code-tabs
@tab aop.ts

```ts
import { getWeaver } from '@aspectjs/core';

getWeaver().enable(new LogErrorsAspect());
```

:::

It is recommended to enable the aspects all in once in a single file called `aop.ts`.
:::code-tabs
@tab aop.ts

```ts
import { getWeaver } from '@aspectjs/core';
import { LogErrorsAspect } from './log-errors.aspect';

getWeaver().enable(new LogErrorsAspect());
```

Once enabled, an aspect cannot be disabled. However, enabling the same aspect twice will replace the first aspect.

> **danger** An aspect should be enabled before actually using a class that uses any annotation the aspect relates to.
