# @aspectjs/nestjs

## Why ?

NestJS heavily relies on [Experimental decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) to provide a clean and modern design architecture based on AOP.

This package offers a conversion of some NestJS decorators into **AspectJS annotations**, allowing you to repurpose these annotations with external aspects.
