# @aspectjs/nestjs

## üí° Why ?

NestJS heavily relies on [experimental decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) to provide a clean and modern design architecture based on AOP.  
This package offers a conversion of some NestJS decorators into **AspectJS annotations**, allowing you to repurpose these annotations with external aspects.

By themselves, the annotations do nothing, but they require the activation of third-party aspects to introduce actual behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
npm i @aspectjs/nestjs
```
