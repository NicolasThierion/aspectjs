# aspectjs-demo-simple-toast

This project shows how to create typesafe zero-code http clients with the help of [`httyped-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httyped-client) package. With the help of the `@Memo()` annotation from [`@aspectjs/memo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aspectjs/memo) , the http client leverages memoization to enhance performance.
