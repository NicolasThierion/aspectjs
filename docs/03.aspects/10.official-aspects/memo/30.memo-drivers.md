# Memo Drivers

## Memo drivers

`MemoAspect` needs to store the memoized data into some storage API. 
The `MemoDriver` are the part of the *Memo Pipeline*,
that provide a standardized API to actually store both sync and async data.

The driver interface itself is not tight to any storage API, and it requires a concrete implementation. 
At the moment, the following drivers are available:

- ### `LsMemoDriver`

Stores data into the [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
Accepts a custom `localStorage` implementation (eg: polyfills for NodeJS), as well as a serializer.
By default, it is configured to use `LzMemoSerializer` that compresses data with a compression algorithm 
based on [lz-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lz-string) before storage.

- ### `IdbMemoDriver`

Stores data into the [`indexedDb`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). 
Accepts a custom `indexedDb` implementation (eg: polyfills for NodeJS).

> ![danger] IndexedDb is async only. Because of this, `IdbMemoDriver` cannot be used to store non-async types, 
> and `@Memo()` will automatically privilege other drivers.  

> ![info] Because the data type must be known with no delay, 
> some parts of the `MemoFrame` are stored synchronously with `LsMemoDriver` under the hood.
