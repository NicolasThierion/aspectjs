# Enable an aspect

## Enable an aspect
Many aspects may be declared in your project, but they won't be used unless they are enabled.
This way, you can configure the behaviour of an annotation on the go, 
based on your needs or the deployment target for example.

To enable an aspect, you have to get a reference to the global `Weaver`: 

```js
import { WEAVER_CONTEXT } from '@aspectjs/core';

WEAVER_CONTEXT.getWeaver()      // get the global weaver instance
    .enable(new MyAspect());    // enable the aspect
```

> ![danger] You have to enable all aspects at the very beginning of your code,
> especially before any reference to an annotation. 
> Once an annotation gets interpreted, the weaver configuration is sealed and attempting to enable or disable an aspect will throw an error.

## Enable a profile

Sometimes, several complementary aspects have to be enabled together, and they are part of a `WeaverProfile`.
Profiles are enabled or disabled the same way aspects do:

```js
import { WeaverProfile } from '@aspectjs/core/commons'
import { WEAVER_CONTEXT } from '@aspectjs/core';

export class MyAspectsProfile extends WeaverProfile {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.enable(new MyAspectA(), new MyAspectB());
    }
}


WEAVER_CONTEXT.getWeaver()              // get the global weaver instance
    .enable(new MyAspectsProfile());    // enable the profile
```

> ![warning] The `WEAVER_CONTEXT` exposes a bunch of `registries`, `factories`
> and other tools that are considered low-level, and won't be documented at the moment.
